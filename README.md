# Data Science

I am a data scientist experienced in developing business solutions end-to-end, from collecting data and creating Machine Learning models and finally implementing.
I have developed regression and classification problems. The details of each one of them are below.

Analytical tools:
- Data Collection: Postgres.
- Data Manipulation: Python, Pandas.
- Data Visualization, Deploy and Cloud with Heroku.
- Exploratory Data Analysis with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Data Preparation and Feature Selection with Boruta, Random Forest.
- Machine Learning: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Linear and Logistic Regressions, KNN, etc.

## Data Science Projects

[Health Insurance Cross Sell - Learning to Rank Project](https://github.com/lbVictor/Health_Insurance_Cross_Sell)

Insurance All is a company that provides health insurance to its customers and the product team is analyzing the possibility of offering a new product: Car insurance.

The company surveyed nearly 380,000 customers about interest in joining a new auto insurance product last year. All customers showed interest or not in purchasing auto insurance and these responses were saved in a database along with other customer attributes.

The product team selected 127,000 new customers who did not respond to the survey to participate in a campaign, in which they will receive an offer of the new car insurance product. The offer will be made by the sales team through phone calls. However, the sales team has the capacity to make 20,000 calls within the campaign period.

This project consists of raising insights for the business and, through Machine Learning techniques, generate a list ordered by purchase propensity for the business team to identify potential customers to carry out the car insurance offer.

[Rossmann - Sales Prediction Project](https://github.com/lbVictor/Sales_Prediction)

Rossmann's CFO recently asked store managers for a forecast of the next six weeks of sales, as based on this information, he intends to define the investment that will be made in the renovation of each store. Given the requested information and the lack of accurate response from store managers, the data science team suggested the development of a Machine Learning solution for this problem, prioritizing the quality of information and ease of access by stakeholders.


[Insiders Clustering](https://github.com/lbVictor/Insiders_Clustering)

Clustering Project to obtain which customers should participate in a loyalty program called Insiders. (Project under development - start 2022/02/14)
